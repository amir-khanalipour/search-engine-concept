## general overview of implementation of web search engine with elastic search<br/><br/>
![](picture.png)

we implemented web search engine with elastic. <br>
ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž in next version we want to implement key functionality of elastic instead of using it. 
.
### get started with project

it's very easy to run that

1) <b>install Docker from official page</b>
2) use following command for start in <b>development mode</b> . open <b>powershell</b> or <b>git-bash</b> 
            
       chmod +x start-development-services.sh
       bash start-development-services.sh

2) its amazing all services and dependency installed and configured properly
--------------------------------------------------

after run all service & dependency for project to work correctly
we need two thing

1) add domain with crawler-service to crawler that domain and related page .and automatically index that in search-service from crawled webpage

we do it manually from swagger . but we can generate ui for that and only admin user can do that  <br/>
<span style="font-weight:500;font-family:Verdana">it accessible at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html</span>

2) you access to all document generated from start point of <b>crawler-service</b> in <b>kibana dashboard</b>
   <span style="font-weight:500;font-family:Verdana"> at address(http://localhost:5601) by <i>username -> <b>elastic</b> & password -> <b>123456</b> </i> </span>. <br/>

it has amazing visualization dashboard like bellow

3) also using search-service endpoint at <span style="font-weight:500;font-family:Verdana">(http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui/index.html) </span>  to retrieve clear result for <b>suggestion & search</b> that read from elastic index <br/>

we fortunately create ui for show suggestion and search from <span style="font-weight:600">search-service</span> same as <b style="color:blue">G</b><b style="color:red">o</b><b style="color:orange">o</b><b style="color:blue">g</b><b style="color:green">l</b><b style="color:red">e</b> .<br/> <span style="font-weight:500;font-family:Verdana">it accessible at http://localhost:3000</span>

i generate ui for autocomplete in search-box and select that. like picture bellow <br/>

-----------------------------------------------------------------

and after select input we search base on query to find most related document and rank them. like picture bellow

<br>
over time our dataset is larger and our suggestion it can be more precise and search result is more
